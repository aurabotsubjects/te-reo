      title:'Tāua Kōrero — Listen & discover',
      instruction:'Today we are going to learn our very first words in te reo Māori. I am going to say some words and phrases, and I want you to just listen and notice the sounds. There is nothing to write down — just watch and listen.',
      example:`<b><a class="te-aka-link" href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=kia%20ora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kia ora</a></b> — Hello / Thank you<br><b><a class="te-aka-link" href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=t%C4%93n%C4%81%20koe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tēnā koe</a></b> — Hello (formal, to one person)<br><b>Kei te <a class="te-aka-link" href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=p%C4%93hea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pēhea</a> koe?</b> — How are you?<br><b>Kei te <a class="te-aka-link" href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=pai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pai</a> au</b> — I am good<br><b>E <a class="te-aka-link" href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=noho" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noho</a> rā</b> — Goodbye (to someone staying)<br><b>Hei <a class="te-aka-link" href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=kon%C4%81" target="_blank" rel="noopener">konā</a> rā</b> — Goodbye (casual)`,
      demo:`Notice the vowels. In te reo Māori, every vowel makes only ONE sound — always:\n\n<b>A</b> = "ah"  ·  <b>E</b> = "eh"  ·  <b>I</b> = "ee"  ·  <b>O</b> = "oh"  ·  <b>U</b> = "oo"\n\nSay "Kia ora" — KIA = "kee-ah", ORA = "oh-rah". Kia ora. Simple, consistent, beautiful.`,
      tip:'The vowel sounds never change. Once you know them, you can pronounce any Māori word. That\'s a superpower.',
    },

      title:'Kia Tūhono — Build together',
      instruction:'Let\'s practise these greetings together. I will say the Māori — you say it back. Then we will figure out when you would use each one.',
      sentences:[
        '<b>Kia ora</b> — When would you say this? (casual hello or thank you)',
        '<b>Tēnā koe</b> — This is more formal. When might a student use it? (to a teacher, elder, or visitor)',
        '<b>Kei te pēhea koe?</b> — Break it apart: Kei te = right now, pēhea = how, koe = you. Put it together!',
        '<b>Kei te pai au</b> — kei te = right now, pai = good, au = I/me. Say it: "Right now good I."',

    iDo:{
      title:'Tāua Kōrero — Watch & discover',
      instruction:'Yesterday we learned how to greet someone. Today we learn how to tell people who we are. In te reo Māori, there is a special word we use when we identify or name something. Watch how it works.',
      example:`<b>Ko</b> Aroha <b>tōku <a class="te-aka-link" href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=ingoa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingoa</a></b>.<br>= My name is Aroha.<br><br><b>Ko</b> <a class="te-aka-link" href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=wai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wai</a> <b>tōu ingoa?</b><br>= What is your name?<br><br><b>Ko</b> Wiremu <b>tōna ingoa</b>.<br>= His/her name is Wiremu.`,
      demo:`The word <b>Ko</b> is used whenever we are saying what something <b>IS</b> — its identity or name.\n\nThe pattern is simple:\n<b>Ko</b> + [name] + [whose] + <b>ingoa</b>\n\n"Ingoa" means "name". "Tōku" = my. "Tōu" = your. "Tōna" = his or her.\n\nNotice: te reo Māori does NOT have separate words for "he" and "she". Tōna covers both.`,
      tip:'Ko is like a pointer — it points at what something IS. Ko = "it is" or "my name is."',
    },
    weDo:{
      title:'Kia Tūhono — Build together',
      instruction:'Let\'s build Ko sentences together. I will give you the pieces — you put them in the right order.',

        'Now put it all together — greet someone AND introduce yourself: <b>Kia ora. Ko [name] tōku ingoa.</b>',
      ],
      prompt:'Why do you think te reo Māori uses Ko rather than just saying "my name is"? What does it feel like to say your name this way?',
    },
    youDo:{
      title:'Māu Anō — Your turn',
      instruction:'Use the Ko structure to introduce yourself — written or spoken.',
      tasks:[
        'Write: <b>Ko [your name] tōku ingoa.</b> Say it aloud.',
        'Ask the person next to you their name using <b>Ko wai tōu ingoa?</b> Then introduce them to someone else.',

    iDo:{
      title:'Tāua Kōrero — Watch & discover',
      instruction:'So far we have learned how to greet people and say our names. Now we are going to learn how to talk about what is happening RIGHT NOW. Watch how te reo Māori builds a present-tense sentence.',
      example:`<b>Kei te</b> <a class="te-aka-link" href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=haere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haere</a> <b>au</b>.<br>= I am going.<br><br><b>Kei te</b> <a class="te-aka-link" href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=kai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kai</a> <b>koe</b>.<br>= You are eating.<br><br><b>Kei te</b> <a class="te-aka-link" href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=moe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moe</a> <b>ia</b>.<br>= He/she is sleeping.`,
      demo:`The pattern for right-now actions is always:\n\n<b>Kei te</b> + [action word] + [person]\n\n"Kei te" is like "-ing" in English — it shows the action is happening NOW.\n\nAction words: <b>haere</b> = go/going · <b>kai</b> = eat/eating · <b>moe</b> = sleep/sleeping\n\nPeople: <b>au</b> = I/me · <b>koe</b> = you · <b>ia</b> = he/she`,
      tip:'In te reo Māori, the action comes FIRST, then the person. "Is-going I" not "I am going." The structure is always Time/Action → Action word → Person.',
    },
    weDo:{
      title:'Kia Tūhono — Build together',
      instruction:'Use the Kei te structure to build these sentences together. I will give you the pieces — you put them in order.',
      sentences:[
        'How do you say "I am eating"? Pieces: Kei te · kai · au → <b>Kei te kai au.</b>',
        'How do you say "She is sleeping"? Pieces: Kei te · moe · ia → <b>Kei te moe ia.</b>',
        'How do you say "You are going"? Pieces: Kei te · haere · koe → <b>Kei te haere koe.</b>',
        'Now say all three out loud one after another — notice how the structure never changes, only the action word and person swap.',
      ],
      prompt:'The structure Kei te + action + person never changes. How is that different from English, where we change "I go / she goes"? Which feels easier?',
    },
    youDo:{
      title:'Māu Anō — Your turn',
      instruction:'Build your own Kei te sentences using the words you have learned.',
      tasks:[
        'Write and say: <b>Kei te kai au.</b> Now swap to "you" — Kei te kai koe.',
        'Use <b>haere</b> (going) in three sentences — one for au, one for koe, one for ia.',
        'Look around the room. What are people doing? Write one Kei te sentence about what a classmate is doing.',

    iDo:{
      title:'Tāua Kōrero — Watch & discover',
      instruction:'Today we put everything together into a real conversation. Watch me roleplay a full exchange — from greeting to introducing to asking what someone is doing.',
      example:`<b>A:</b> Kia ora! Ko wai tōu ingoa?<br><b>B:</b> Ko Mere tōku ingoa. Ko wai tōu?<br><b>A:</b> Ko Tama tōku ingoa. Kei te pēhea koe?<br><b>B:</b> Kei te pai au, kia ora.

Hei konā rā.<br><b>A:</b> Hei konā rā!`,
      demo:`New phrase: <b>Kei te aha koe?</b> — What are you doing?\n<b>Aha</b> = what. So "Kei te aha koe?" literally means "Right now what you?" → "What are you doing?"\n\nNew phrase: <b>ki te kura</b> — to school (<b>ki</b> = to, <b>kura</b> = school)\n\nNew word: <b>Āe</b> — Yes!\n\nYou now have everything you need for a genuine short conversation in te reo Māori.`,
      tip:'A real conversation has a rhythm: greet → introduce → ask → answer → farewell. Once you know the pattern, you just swap in the pieces.',

        'I say I am going to school. How do you say goodbye? Use <b>Hei konā rā</b> or <b>E noho rā</b>.',

      instruction:'Today we learn how to say who things belong to. In te reo Māori there are two ways to say "mine" or "yours" — and which one you use depends on what KIND of thing you are talking about. Listen carefully and you will start to feel the difference.',

(things you don't control)<br><b>Nōku tēnā.</b> — That is mine.<br><b>Nōu tēnā.</b> — That is yours.<br><b>Nōna tēnā.</b> — That is his/hers.<br><br><b>Nā wai tēnā?</b> — Whose is that? (things you do control)<br><b>Nāku tēnā.</b> — That is mine.<br><b>Nāu tēnā.</b> — That is yours.<br><b>Nāna tēnā.</b> — That is his/hers.`,
